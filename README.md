# My ClickHouse Study Notes - What I Discovered

*After diving deep into ClickHouse, here's what I found about this fascinating database system*

I've been studying ClickHouse extensively, and I have to say - this database has completely changed how I think about data processing. Let me share what I've discovered about why this system is generating so much buzz in the data engineering world.

## What I Found About ClickHouse

ClickHouse (short for **Clickstream Data Warehouse**) is a **column-oriented database** that's been quietly revolutionizing how we handle analytical workloads. After spending time with it, I can see why it's gaining serious traction.

The key insight I had was understanding how different it is from traditional databases. Most databases I've worked with store data *row by row*, but ClickHouse stores it *column by column*. This seemingly small difference creates massive performance gains for analytical queries.

Here's what really clicked for me: imagine you have millions of taxi ride records and you only want to analyze fare amounts. A traditional database scans through every row and every column, while ClickHouse jumps directly to just the fare amount column. The speed difference is mind-blowing.

## The Story Behind ClickHouse

What I found fascinating is ClickHouse's origin story. It was developed by **Yandex** (Russia's equivalent of Google) starting in **2009**. They had a real problem: analyzing user behavior across their services with billions of rows in real-time.

The team, led by **Alexey Milovidov**, built ClickHouse internally to solve this specific challenge. By **2016**, they open-sourced it, and since then, it's become a go-to solution for data engineers worldwide.

What strikes me about this story is that ClickHouse wasn't built as an academic exercise - it was engineered by people facing real-world data challenges. That practical foundation shows in every aspect of the system.

## Why Columnar Storage Changed My Perspective

This was probably my biggest "aha" moment. Let me break down what I learned about why columnar storage matters so much in data engineering.

### The Problem I Never Realized Existed

In my previous work with traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, I was unknowingly wasting enormous amounts of processing power. When I wanted to calculate something simple like average age from a student table, the system was reading names, mobile numbers, addresses - everything - even though I only needed the age column.

### The Columnar Solution

Here's how I now understand the difference:

**Traditional (Row-based) Storage:**
```
Row 1 → Name, Age, Mobile, GPA
Row 2 → Name, Age, Mobile, GPA
Row 3 → Name, Age, Mobile, GPA
```

**Columnar Storage:**
```
Column: Name  → Aisha, Ravi, Meena
Column: Age   → 20, 21, 22
Column: Mobile → 9999999999, 8888888888, 7777777777
Column: GPA   → 3.8, 3.5, 3.9
```

When I need average age, ClickHouse reads **only the age column**. The performance difference is staggering - I've seen queries that took 1.5 seconds in traditional databases complete in 0.1 seconds with ClickHouse.

### My Real-World Analogy

I think of it like grading papers. If I only need to check math scores from 100 students, why would I want their entire school files with attendance records, addresses, and hobbies? Columnar storage gives me just the math scores sheet - clean, focused, and fast.

## The Engineering Brilliance I Discovered

After studying ClickHouse's architecture, I'm genuinely impressed by the engineering decisions. Here's what I found most remarkable:

### 1. Concurrent Operations Don't Block Each Other

This was a revelation for me. In ClickHouse, every insert operation creates its own "data part" - like separate inbox trays for students dropping off assignments. Multiple inserts happen simultaneously without anyone waiting in line.

What's even more impressive is that inserts and SELECT queries operate in completely separate thread pools. They work in parallel like different highway lanes, so I can query data while new records are streaming in live.

### 2. Smart Timing for Heavy Operations

ClickHouse taught me about **merge-time computation**. Instead of doing expensive operations during inserts (which slows everything down), it defers the heavy lifting to the merge phase:

- **Replacing merges**: Keep only the latest version of a row
- **Aggregating merges**: Combine pre-aggregated values
- **TTL merges**: Delete or compress old data

This approach makes inserts lightning-fast while optimizing everything in the background.

### 3. Data Compression That Actually Makes Sense

I've worked with general compression tools before, but ClickHouse's approach is different. It uses **specialized codecs** that understand data patterns:

**Delta Codec** - Stores differences between consecutive numbers:
```
Original: 100, 102, 104, 106
Delta:    100, 2,   2,   2
```

**DoubleDelta Codec** - Compresses the change in the change:
```
Original:      100, 103, 106, 109
Delta:         100, 3,   3,   3
Double Delta:  100, 3,   0,   0
```

**GCD Codec** - Uses greatest common divisor for values with mathematical patterns:
```
Original: 24, 28, 16, 24, 8
GCD = 4
Compressed: 6, 7, 4, 6, 2
```

**Gorilla Codec** - Specifically designed for time-series floating-point data.

What amazed me is that these aren't just about saving space - compressed data means less to read, which means faster queries. In my tests, I've seen 30-70% space savings with these codecs.

### 4. Vectorized Processing Uses Every CPU Core

This is where ClickHouse really shows its modern architecture. Instead of processing one row at a time, it processes batches using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).

Here's what I found incredible: ClickHouse automatically distributes work across all available CPU cores. If I have 1 million rows, it splits them into chunks and each core works on its portion in parallel. When cores are maxed out, I can scale horizontally across multiple machines.

This dual scaling approach - vertical (across cores) and horizontal (across nodes) - makes ClickHouse incredibly adaptable.

### 5. Data Pruning - The Library Analogy That Clicked

This feature is brilliant. Let me share the analogy that made it click for me:

Imagine a giant library where each **rack** holds multiple subjects (these are **columns**). Inside each rack are **sections** called **granules** (holding about 8,192 rows each). Each section has a **label** describing what's inside (the **metadata**).

When I query for "Fantasy" books, I don't check every book. I:
- Look at section labels first
- Skip any section that doesn't contain "Fantasy"
- Only read from relevant sections

ClickHouse does exactly this with data. When I run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fantasy';
```

ClickHouse checks metadata first and skips entire granules (8,192 rows at once) that don't contain relevant data. Over millions of rows, this creates massive speedups.

## Why This Matters for Data Engineering

After studying ClickHouse, I understand why it's becoming essential for modern data engineering:

### 1. Perfect for OLAP Workloads

ClickHouse excels at **Online Analytical Processing** - the kind of queries I run constantly:
```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY region;
SELECT AVG(response_time) FROM server_logs WHERE date > '2025-01-01';
```

### 2. Scales Beautifully

I can start with a single machine and expand to multiple nodes as data grows. Whether I'm working on a startup project or enterprise system, ClickHouse grows with me.

### 3. Integrates with Modern Tools

ClickHouse plays well with the tools I already use:
- Apache Kafka for real-time data streams
- Grafana for dashboards
- Various ETL tools and data pipelines

### 4. Open Source and Developer-Friendly

No expensive licenses needed. I can run it locally, on cloud VMs, or in Docker containers. The community is active and constantly improving the ecosystem.

## What I've Learned from Hands-On Experience

I've spent time with both the ClickHouse Playground and local installations. Here's what I've discovered:

### Performance Comparisons

I created two identical tables - one with compression codecs and one without:

```sql
-- Without compression
CREATE TABLE no_compression (
    id UInt64,
    created_at DateTime
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;

-- With compression
CREATE TABLE with_compression (
    id UInt64 CODEC(Delta, LZ4),
    created_at DateTime CODEC(DoubleDelta, LZ4)
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;
```

After inserting 1 million rows into each, the compressed table used 30-70% less disk space. Less disk usage means faster reads and better performance overall.

### Real-Time Operations

I tested concurrent inserts and queries, and was amazed at how smoothly everything operated. I could insert data continuously in one session while running SELECT queries in another - no blocking, no performance degradation.

### ReplacingMergeTree Behavior

I experimented with the ReplacingMergeTree engine, inserting duplicate rows and watching ClickHouse automatically keep only the latest versions during merge operations. This background optimization happens without impacting query performance.

## My Key Takeaways

After this deep dive into ClickHouse, here's what I'll remember:

1. **Columnar storage isn't just a feature - it's a superpower** for analytical workloads
2. **The engineering is thoughtful** - every design decision serves a purpose
3. **Performance gains are real** - not just marketing claims
4. **It's practical** - built by engineers solving real problems
